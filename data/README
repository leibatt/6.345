main output: bench.csv
generated by doing this from the wired-al-yankovic/ directory:
  $ mkdir bench
  $ ruby bench.rb > bench.txt
  $ ruby bench-post.rb > bench.csv
(the bench.rb and bench-post.rb scripts are copied to this directory)

the number of transitions is just the number of lines in the file (so it'll be off by (2 + number of end states)

these are the steps:
1	fst from_string - i gonna be a mighty king |
2	fst compose -t - pocket_bcf-inverted-closure.fst - |
3	fst compose -t - phoneme_to_stress.fst - |
4	fst compose -t - stress_to_phoneme.fst - |
5	fst compose -t - pocket_bcf-closure.fst - |
6	fst clear_weights - - |
7	fst compose -t - lyrics-ngram.fst - |
8	fst nbest -s -o -n 30 - -
(note that the 'number of transitions' for the last one is the number of nbest candidates, since the output is a list of strings)
